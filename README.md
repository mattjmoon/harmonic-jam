# Harmonic Jam - Company Management System

## Project Overview

Harmonic Jam is a full-stack application designed to manage and interact with a large database of companies. It allows users to view, like, and manage collections of companies efficiently.

## Backend

The backend is built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, providing a robust API for company management.

### Approach

1. **Database Design**: Utilized SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL for efficient data management.
2. **API Structure**: Implemented RESTful endpoints for company and collection operations.
3. **Pagination**: Implemented server-side pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.
4. **Optimization**: Used SQL window functions and subqueries to optimize database queries.

### Assumptions and Tradeoffs

1. **Liked Companies**: Assumed a single "Liked Companies" collection for simplicity.
2. **Database Performance**: Prioritized query optimization over additional features.

### Next Steps

1. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching to reduce database load for frequently accessed data.
2. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for better code reliability.
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Enhance logging and add monitoring tools for better observability.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React and Material-UI, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.

### Approach

1. **Component Structure**: Developed reusable components for maintainability.
2. **State Management**: Used React hooks for local state management.
3. **API Integration**: Implemented custom hooks for API calls and data fetching.
4. **UI/UX**: Focused on a clean, responsive design with intuitive interactions.

### Assumptions and Tradeoffs

1. **Client-Side Filtering**: Implemented client-side filtering for liked companies to reduce server load.
2. **Pagination**: Used server-side pagination, assuming large datasets.
3. **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error notifications, assuming most errors would be network-related.

### Next Steps

1. **State Management**: Consider implementing Redux or React Context for more complex state management.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement virtualization for large lists to improve rendering performance.
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests and end-to-end tests for components and user flows.

## Reflection

This project presents an interesting challenge in managing and displaying large datasets efficiently. The backend focus on query optimization and the frontend's emphasis on responsive design and efficient data loading worked well together to create a smooth user experience.

One of the main challenges was balancing the need for real-time updates with server performance. The decision to use server-side pagination was important in managing large datasets, but it also introduced complexity in maintaining consistent state between the frontend and backend.

If given more time, I would focus on enhancing the application's scalability and user experience. This would include lowering database query time, adding comprehensive testing, and exploring caching strategies to further optimize performance.

The current implementation provides a solid foundation, but there's room for improvement in areas such as security, performance optimization, and additional features like advanced search and filtering capabilities.
